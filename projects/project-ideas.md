## Project ideas
These are projects I am interested in solving with RL but do not have the background knowledge to fully understand. I plan to gain this requisite knowledge by reading *Reinforcement Learning, an Introduction* by Sutton and Barto and implementing a series of smaller RL projects throughout the process.

##### Game player agents
- Training agents to play the two-to-four player perfect information game *Quoridor*
- Training an agent to navigate an open-world game to achieve some set of objectives
- Training an agent to compete in a platform fighting game like *Super Smash Bros. Melee*
